# Phonon Scattering Rates Data for Silicon and HgTe

This repository contains the phonon scattering rates data used in a peer-review paper. 

The data corresponds to Figure 3 in the paper and includes information on the phonon scattering rates for two materials: silicon and HgTe.

## Contents

  - **`scattering-rates/figure-imse.ipynb`**: the python jupyter notebook that generates the figure 3 from the scattering rates raw data.
